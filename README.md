# Happy Party Rentals Website Repository

## Intro
Welcome to the Happy Party Rentals Website Repository.  
This website is being developed as a part of my freelancing journey and is the first order I am taking on as a freelancer. 
As a part of our agreement with the website owner, the website's codebase will be made public to showcase it in my portfolio.

## Goal
The main goal is to compose all the texts and fully develop this website according to the customer's expectations within one month, juggling it alongside my college program and part-time job commitments. I will be dedicating 2-3 hours per day to bring this project to life.

## Contents
In this repository, you will find:
- Codebase: This website is being developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Feel free to browse through the repository at your own pace and explore this project's insides.
- Resources: Access all the assets, images, and other essential files used for the website's development, design, and functionality.
- Texts: Most of the text content you see on the website is custom and personally written to cater to the customer's specific requirements.

## Get Involved
Any reasonable and constructive feedback and contributions would be much appreciated and will surely make my journey more engaging and challenging. Any ideas and proposals on enhancing this website, design, or functionality will be warmly welcomed and considered to make Happy Party Rentals an unforgettable online experience.
